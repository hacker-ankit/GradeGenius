# GradeGenius
This project leverages machine learning classifiers to predict the factors influencing student grades using a CSV dataset. 
The dataset includes students from various nationalities and grade levels, along with key factors such as the number of hands raised, attendance records, and study hours. 
Various classifiers and ML models are employed to determine which factors most significantly impact student performance.
Additionally, visual aids like graphs and confusion matrices are generated to illustrate the findings.
